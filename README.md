# Client Insight ðŸ“Š

This is a small data project I created while learning data analysis and basic machine learning in Python.

The dataset contains simulated (randomly generated) client data, such as:
- age,
- income,
- gender,
- and written comments.

I treated it like a mini real-world project to practice:
- data cleaning,
- feature engineering,
- simple visualizations (with seaborn and matplotlib),
- a logistic regression model to predict satisfaction based on age and income.

## Tools used

- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

## What I learned from it ðŸ’¡

- How to handle missing values
- How to create new features based on conditions
- How to visualize relationships in data
- How to build and evaluate a basic classification model

This is not a perfect project - but I made it to learn, test myself, and have something real to put on GitHub ðŸ˜Š It may be small, but it shows real progress and curiosity.
